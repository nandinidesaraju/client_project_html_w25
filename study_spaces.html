            <ul>

                <li><strong>Access to Outlets:</strong> If you’ll be studying for long hours, check for locations with ample charging stations, such as the Duderstadt Center.</li>
                <li><strong>Study Hours:</strong> Need a late-night study session? The UgLi and Duderstadt Center have extended hours.</li>
                <li><strong>Food and Coffee:</strong> If you like snacking while studying, consider spaces near cafes like Shapiro, Ross, or Pierpont Commons.</li>
            </ul>
